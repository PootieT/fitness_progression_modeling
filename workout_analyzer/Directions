# Directions:

## Research: 
- Plot Body Part Development: 
	- Average body part, then look at association, point out weakness, and strength,
	- by finding the difference in weight you do, roughly calculate difference in muscle volume between different groups

- Muscle Group BodyPart Generation:
- Muscle / Exercise relationship

- keep soreness status for each muscle group over time
	- like each body part is a jar of water, once you have enough you can workout another part
	- soreness can be initial manual input in that, over time predict

- varying individual exercises
	- randomly combine, such that eeach part has a good workout

- understand heavy set and rep set difference in breaking down type I/II muscle types
	- vary it up a bit

- the million dollar question is:
	- how do you generate the optimal workout for you at the right time
	- what is the reward? 
		- increase in weight you do next time
			- (weight) weighing combination of 1RM and single set volumne
			- (exercise) mapp to muscle group ultimately
		- optimal muscle recovery time +-
		- soreness next day




## App

- randomly add werid trianing tips and add them to different exercise, if user like, add to inventory of shit to try

- Add pre-defined exercise templates, and interface for displaying exercise set and weight
